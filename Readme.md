Item Catalog App

Introduction -
In this project I made a website in which can login with your gmail accounts securely and create,update,read and delete the items. In this project you will have different categories and the items required for that particular category is also present. There wil be small description of the items present.

To Run -
I have written this code in python using flask framework.

Steps:-
1. You must have virtual box by oracle and vagrant machine installed in your machine to run these codes.
2. You need to setup your vagrant machine.
3. After setting up your vagrant machine keep all the codes inside vagrant folder.
4. After you have saved all the codes in a folder inside vagrant folder you must open your vagrant virtual machine.
5. You must login in your vagrant id and set the path to the folder of the catalog.
6. If you are using sublime text editor then to populate your database you can use "ctrl + B" to add the items.
7. After doing all things in the end you must write "python project.py" and the code will run.
8. Remember that all the html files should be in templates folder inside catalog folder and all css files should be inside static folder and also keep in mind that all these things should be in same folder.
